# NYSE-Graphs

This website displays a very specific selection of the the New York Stock Exchange companies' fundamentals in the form of graphs. It is intended to give a quick financial overview of the listed companies so that the user can make a quicker and better decision on investing funds on the companies in question. The graphs look at the industries the the companies are part of, the cash ratio, the current ratio, EBIT by industy, top 10 companies by EBIT, top 10 companies by GP, the GP to EBIT positioning in a scatter plot and finally the EBIT to quick ration location of the companies in a scatter plot. 

## UX

This website is intended to aid the beginner to mid level investor who wishes to ensure that the money invested is indeed invested in a safe company with a solid set of accounts which would give a bigger probability of capital appreciation in the future. The financial information displayed will be more useful to a value investor as it displays the financial health of the companies. The user will be able to quickly identify the best finacially performing company in the entire NYSE which in turn can be filtered by industry. 

- A value investor would land on the page and is in an instant exposed to very clear and digestable graphs giving the user very specific and useful information in the first 6 graphs. The user is able to filter the information required by making selections in the graphs. The user can further compare companies performance with peers in the last two graphs. In order to reset the information a reset button has been created for the user to clear all the selections previously taken and start from scratch.
